# Data package for time-series expression profiles by RNA-seq from [PRJNA275011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/275011)

## Sources

  * Experimental data were generated by Owens et al. (2016) Original citations:
    * Owens NDL, Blitz IL, Lane MA, Patrushev I et al. Measuring Absolute RNA Copy Numbers at High Temporal Resolution Reveals Transcriptome Kinetics in Development. Cell Rep 2016 Jan 26;14(3):632-647. PMID: 26774488
  * Processing:
    * Sequencing reads were downloaded from SRA, at [PRJNA275011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA275011)
    * FASTQC was run to check for overall quality. No adapter sequence was found.
    * Reads were aligned to genome using STAR 2.7.1a, on Xenopus tropicalis genome from Ensembl, (Xtro 9.1 + ERCC-92), and abundance levels were estimated using RSEM.
  
## Usage

Install the package, import the library and load the data set

```R
devtools::install_github('ttdtrang/data-rnaseq-XtroDev')
data(xtro.rnaseq.gene, package='data.rnaseq.XtroDev')
dim(xtro.rnaseq.gene@assayData$exprs)
```

## Steps to re-produce data curation

1. `cd data-raw`
2. Download all necessary raw data files.
3. Set the environment variable `DBDIR` to point to the path containing said files
4. Run the R notebook `make-data-package.Rmd` to assemble parts into `ExpressionSet` objects.
